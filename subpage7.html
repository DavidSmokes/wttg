		<h1 class="text-medium strong"> Welcome to MyRaid </h1>
		<p> If you are like us and want to change the world in a different way, you're in the right place!
			<br>We want to change the destiny of our world but through extreme pain
			<br>We do not want to change this filthy world through compassion.
			<br>The world has never changed dramatically from times of peace. </p>
		<p> The world is only changed from hatred and suffering. To achieve true peace, pain is necessary.
			<br>As long as everyone on this earth does not feel the same pain, no one will be equal and there will be no meaning to our
			world! </p>
		<p> Peace is only achieved when a human being has no more options.
			<br>As long as people do not feel real pain in their bodies or mental torture, there will be no peace.
			<br>No, for real peace to happen, to feel complete. War and destruction must begin. Chaos, blood, and the lives
			<br>of those you love most must rain down to the ground in death here and in all corners of society.
			<br> Once the filthy, pointless masses have experienced true pain and find peace, the world will be a good place to live.
			</p>
		<p> The assault must be initiated! We must create a pure society eliminating all those who believe in how useless and
			<br>stupid we are, that we do not belong on this world, or any trash the behaves in divinity. We must not remain, we must die.
			<br>The problem in this world is humanity believing they can control their destiny and that they are at peace. </p>
		<p> Our organization's purpose is to recruit all people who have the same objectives as ours.
			<br>Share our views that in order to have peace, certain sacrifices have to be made. Destruction and chaos are necessary.
			<br>Much of this worlds garbage will need to die no matter who they are.
			<br>They are remains of a weaker age and do not deserve to share the same space as the others!</p>
		<p class="strong"> IF YOU ARE WITH US, WELCOME! </p>
